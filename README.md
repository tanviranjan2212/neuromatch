# Neuromatch
A collection of codes I wrote for an Encoding-Decoding Neuromatch academy project, using the Steinmetz et. al 2019 dataset.
Contents:
1. Encoding stimulus contrast difference as neural spike patterns 
  a. single neural firing rate using a Poisson GLM
  b. single neural spike train using Logistic Regression

2. Decoding decision from neural firing patterns
  a. Dimensionality reduction (GPFA, Autoencoders) and then classifying using a Naive Bayes Classifier
  a. Trajectory through time of reduced components
