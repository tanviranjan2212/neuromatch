# Neuromatch
Neuromatch academy is an online crash course on Computational Neuroscience. I attended it in July-Aug 2020 and loved every bit of it. 

The parent folder here consists of my project as a part of the final evaluation. My part of of the project was focused on building a generalized linear model (GLM) to predict neural firing rate from stimulus history (tanvi_glm.ipynb). We submitted this larger project to the Bernstein conference 2020. The link to this work is on my website

I couldn't attend Neuromatch 2021 due to my internship, but I worked through the tutorials on my own time. This is under neuromatch_21/Week_1 (all files are under the same week)
